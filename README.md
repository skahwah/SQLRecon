# SQLRecon

<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/sqlrecon-40.png">
</p>

SQLRecon is a Microsoft SQL Server toolkit that is designed for offensive reconnaissance and post-exploitation. For detailed information on how to use each technique, refer to the <a href="https://github.com/skahwah/SQLRecon/wiki">wiki</a>. 

<a href="https://github.com/skahwah/SQLRecon/wiki/8.-Prevention,-Detection-and-Mitigation-Guidance">Prevention, detection and mitigation guidance</a> has also been provided for all you defenders out there.

Check out my blog post on the <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/posts/databases-beware-abusing-microsoft-sql-server-with-sqlrecon/">IBM Security Intelligence</a> website.

## Overview

You can download a copy of SQLRecon from the [releases](https://github.com/skahwah/SQLRecon/releases) page. Alternatively, feel free to compile the solution yourself. This should be as straight forward as cloning the repo, double clicking the solution file and building.

## Features

`SQLRecon` is equipped with powerful capabilities designed for sophisticated reconnaissance and post-exploitation within Microsoft SQL Server environments:
- **Active Directory Enumeration**: Discover Server Principal Names (SPNs) associated with SQL Servers to identify potential targets.
- **Linked Server Operations**: Executes commands across linked SQL Server chains for lateral movement.
- **User Impersonation**: Impersonates SQL Server users to elevate privileges and access restricted data.
- **Multiple Authentication Providers**:
    - **Windows Integrated Authentication**: Uses the current user's token.
    - **Active Directory Credentials**: Uses specific domain credentials.
    - **Local SQL Credentials**: Connects using SQL Server usernames and passwords.
    - **Advanced SQL Server Interaction**:
        - **Query Execution**: Executes custom SQL queries.
        - **Schema Retrieval**: Fetches database schema information.
        - **System Procedure Enablement**: Enables procedures like `xp_cmdshell`.
- **SCCM Reconnaissance**: Targets Microsoft SCCM environments to extract configuration details.


## Getting Started

### Enumeration

SQLRecon supports enumerating Active Directory for Server Principal Names (SPNs) that are associated with Microsoft SQL Server.

Enumeration Modules (`/e:, /enum:`) do not require an authentication provider to be supplied.

```
SqlSpns - Use the current user token to enumerate the current AD domain for MSSQL SPNs
        /d:, /domain: | (OPTIONAL) NETBIOS name (DOMAIN) or FQDN of domain (DOMAIN.COM)
```

### Authentication Providers

SQLRecon supports a diverse set of authentication providers to enable interacting with a Microsoft SQL Server. An authentication provider must be supplied (`/a:, /auth:`).


```
WinToken - Use the current users token to authenticate against the SQL database
        /h:, /host: | SQL server hostname or IP
        /database:  | (OPTIONAL) SQL server database name, defaults to 'master'
        /port:      | (OPTIONAL) Defaults to 1433

WinDomain - Use AD credentials to authenticate against the SQL database
        /h:, /host:     | SQL server hostname or IP
        /d:, /domain:   | NETBIOS name (DOMAIN) or FQDN of domain (DOMAIN.COM)
        /u:, /username: | Username for domain user
        /p:, /password: | Password for domain user
        /database:      | (OPTIONAL) SQL server database name, defaults to 'master'
        /port:          | (OPTIONAL) Defaults to 1433

Local - Use local SQL credentials to authenticate against the SQL database
        /h:, /host:     | SQL server hostname or IP
        /u:, /username: | Username for local SQL user
        /p:, /password: | Password for local SQL user
        /database:      | (OPTIONAL) SQL server database name, defaults to 'master'
        /port:          | (OPTIONAL) Defaults to 1433

AzureAD - Use Azure AD credentials to authenticate against the Azure SQL database
        /h:, /host:     | SQL server hostname or IP
        /d:, /domain:   | FQDN of domain (DOMAIN.COM)
        /u:, /username: | Username for domain user
        /p:, /password: | Password for domain user
        /database:      | (OPTIONAL) SQL server database name, defaults to 'master'

AzureLocal - Use local SQL credentials to authenticate against the Azure SQL database
        /h:, /host:     | SQL server hostname or IP
        /u:, /username: | Username for local SQL user
        /p:, /password: | Password for local SQL user
        /database:      | (OPTIONAL) SQL server database name, defaults to 'master'
        /port:          | (OPTIONAL) Defaults to 1433
```

There are cases where a Microsoft SQL Server might not be listening on a standard TCP port. Some examples are Microsoft SQL Server failover clustering, or dynamic TCP ports. SQLRecon supports setting non-standard connection port by supplying the port flag (`/port:`). By default, SQLRecon will connect to databases via TCP Port 1433.

SQLRecon connects to the `master` database by default, however, this can be changed by supplying a custom database name via the database flag (`/database:`).

Please note that the `AzureAD` authentication provider reqires that the Azure Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) or Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) exists on the system SQLRecon is executed from. This is for Azure Active Directory authentication and authorization functionality.

### Standard Modules

Standard modules are executed against a single instance of Microsoft SQL server. Standard modules must be passed into the module flag (`/m:, /module:`).

Modules starting with `[*]` require the sysadmin role or a similar privileged context.

For detailed information on how to use each technique, refer to the <a href="https://github.com/skahwah/SQLRecon/wiki/3.-Standard-Modules">wiki</a>.

```

## SCCM Modules

SQLRecon has several modules that can assist with enumerating and attacking Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) and Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (ECM). 

SCCM modules must be passed into the module flag (`/m:, /module:`).

SCCM and ECM will need to have a Microsoft SQL database exposed either locally or remotely.

Modules starting with `[*]` require the sysadmin role or a similar privileged context.

For detailed information on how to use each technique, refer to the <a href="https://github.com/skahwah/SQLRecon/wiki/6.-SCCM-Modules">wiki</a>. 

```
sUsers                                                | Display all SCCM users
sSites                                                | Display all other sites with data stored
sLogons /option:OPTIONAL_FILTER                       | Display all associated SCCM clients and the last logged in user
sTaskList                                             | Display all task sequences, but do not access the task data contents
sTaskData                                             | Decrypt all task sequences to plaintext
sCredentials                                          | Display encrypted credentials vaulted by SCCM
[*] sDecryptCredentials                               | Attempt to decrypt recovered SCCM credential blobs. Must be ran in a high-integrty or SYSTEM process on an SCCM server
[*] sAddAdmin /user:DOMAIN\USERNAME /sid:SID          | This will elevate a supplied account to a 'Full Administrator' in SCCM
[*] sRemoveAdmin /user:ADMIN_ID /remove:REMOVE_STRING | Removes privileges of a user, or remove a user entirely from the SCCM database
```

The table below contains additional information for each SCCM module:

| Module | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| sUsers | Lists all users in the `RBAC_Admins` table. These are all users configured for some level of access to SCCM. |
| sSites | Lists all other sites with data stored in the SCCM databases' `DPInfo` table. This can provide additional attack avenues as different sites can be configured in different (insecure) ways. |
| sLogons | Queries the `Computer_System_DATA` table to retrieve all associated SCCM clients along with the user that last logged into them. <b>NOTE:</b> This only updates once a week by default and will not be 100% up to date. Use `/option:` as an optional (not required) argument to filter SCCM clients. |
| sTaskList | Provides a list of all task sequences stored in the SCCM database, but does not access the actual task data contents. |
| sTaskData | Recovers all task sequences stored in the SCCM database and decrypts them to plaintext. Task sequences can contain credentials for joining systems to domains, mapping shares, running commands, etc. |
| sCredentials | Lists credentials vaulted by SCCM for use in various functions. These credentials can not be remotely decrypted as the key is stored on the SCCM server. However, this module provides intel on if it makes sense to attempt to obtain the key. |
| sDecryptCredentials | Attempt to decrypt recovered SCCM credential blobs. This module must be ran in a high-integrty or SYSTEM process on an SCCM server. |
| sAddAdmin | This module will elevate the specified account to a 'Full Administrator' within SCCM. If target user is already an SCCM user, this module will instead add necessary privileges to elevate. Provide two arguments, either `/user:current /sid:current` if seeking to add the user currently executing the SQLRecon process as a 'Full Administrator' in SCCM. If seeking to add another user as a 'Full Administrator' in SCCM, specify their domain user name and full SID `/user:DOMAIN\USERNAME /sid:S-1-5-...`.  This module require sysadmin or similar privileges as writing to SCCM database tables is required. |
| sRemoveAdmin | This modlue removes the privileges of a user by removing a newly added user entirely from the SCCM database. If the user already existed in some capacity this module just removes the three roles that were added to the account via writes to the permission table. Use the arguments provided by output of the `sAddAdmin` command to run this command. This module require sysadmin or similar privileges as writing to SCCM database tables is required. |
